# Example database for the UserDetector embedded in UserApparatus
# The following can be freely formatted.
#
# One may use validity time stamps here as needed:
# [ 1995-01-01 13:45:00 ]
# These time stamps follow the same incremental validity scheme
# as the run database

# The database keys need to be prefixed with the detector's prefix
# (usually <apparatus-name>.<detector-name>)
# This may seem redundant since the prefix is already implied by the
# name of this file, but it allows for easy migration of keys to
# other (non file-based) database systems.

# The detector map.
# This is a matrix of numerical values. Multiple lines are allowed.
# The format is:
#  detmap  <crate1> <slot1> <first channel1> <last channel1> <first logical ch1>
#          <crate2> <slot2> <first channel2> <last channel2> <first logical ch2>
#  etc.
# The "first logical channel" is the one assigned to the first hardware channel.

M.cal.detmap = 
    1 3 0 0 0
# total number of PMTs
M.cal.nelem = 1

# The following keys are optional. If missing, defaults will apply:
# pedestals = 0, gains = 1
# This behavior needs to be implemented in the detector's ReadDatabase function

#M.cal.pedestals = 15. 22. 14.5 11.2 17.6
#M.cal.gains = 3.3 3.22 3.54 4.05 3.42
